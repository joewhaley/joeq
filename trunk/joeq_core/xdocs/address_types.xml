    <section name="Address types">
<p>
joeq uses special types to represent raw addresses.  The three types of addresses are:
<ul>
<li>HeapAddress - represents an address in the heap</li>
<li>CodeAddress - represents an address in code</li>
<li>StackAddress - represents an address on the stack</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All three are subclasses of a single type, Address.
</p>
<p>
You can obtain addresses via static methods in the above classes.
<ul>
<li>HeapAddress.getNull() - returns the "null" heap address</li>
<li>HeapAddress.addressOf(Object) - returns the heap address of the given object</li>
<li>StackAddress.getBasePointer() - gets the base pointer in the current stack frame</li>
<li>StackAddress.getStackPointer() - gets the stack pointer in the current stack frame</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, you can get addresses from other addresses.  The "offset(int)" method
returns a new address that is an offset from the given address.  The "peek()"
method dereferences the given address; that is, it returns the address that the given
address points to.  There are other methods in Address for peeking of other data types,
finding the difference between two addresses, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT POINT</strong>: Note that although the Address types are thought
of as subclasses of java.lang.Object by the Java source compiler, they are NOT
objects, and cannot be used as such.  Therefore, it is illegal to call any of the
java.lang.Object methods, such as equals, toString, hashCode, etc. on Address types.
Less obviously, it is illegal to perform "instanceof" operations on them, or even
pass them as "Objects" under any circumstances.

    <section name="&quot;Unsafe&quot; class">
<p>
The Unsafe class has a very simple low level API consisting of a few essential operations:
<ul>
<li>floatToIntBits, intBitsToFloat, doubleToLongBits, longBitsToDouble - change data representations</li>
<li>EAX, get/setThreadBlock, switch register state - read/write the CPU register state</li>
<li>pushArg, invoke - push arguments and call an address in memory</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Methods in the Unsafe class are implemented as native methods, which the compiler
silently replaces with the corresponding low-level operations.
